            'On a warm day in early summer, Abigail the Sheep could feel the excited energy spreading throughout her flock. The fields had turned bright green and little daisies had popped up as if overnight.',
            'Abigail loved to eat daisies.In fact, much like the other sheep, she couldn’t get enough of them.But only she knew of a clearing in the meadow where countless of these delicious little flowers were blooming.',
            'Abigail looked cautiously and as inconspicuously as possible in all directions.She wanted to make sure that no one would see her sneak away.She didn’t see any other sheep around so she headed off to her favorite spot. ',
            '“They seem to be awfully distracted today!” thought Abigail.She grinned to herself.From far away, she could hear the shepherd coming with the tractor.They must be with him.She figured whatever he wanted could wait. ',
            'As soon as Abigail saw the many fresh daisies in the clearing, she forgot about everything else. She carefully nipped one fresh bud off after another and ate them with relish. ',
            '“If the others found out about this place, it would be trampled and grazed in minutes!” thought Abigail.She renewed her resolve not to share this secret place with anyone. ',
            'After she had eaten quite a few daisies and tufts of grass, she began to get sleepy.She figured it couldn’t hurt to take a little rest.She lay down under a shady tree and dozed off.',
            'Suddenly, Abigail woke up to the bleating of the other sheep.She shook herself and ran towards them to see what was the matter.',
            'When she reached her flock, she saw that all the other sheep had very short wool.They looked completely different! ',
            'When they spotted Abigail, one called out to her, “Abigail where have you been ? No one could find you.”',
            '“Oh no! I missed the shearing!” said Abigail.She knew perfectly well that a sheep’s thick wool had to be trimmed in the summer so that they didn’t suffer in the heat. ',
            'All the other sheep looked so fresh.Abigail looked down and saw her thick and somewhat matted winter wool.She imagined having to spend the whole summer under the hot, stuffy mess.It was going to be awful.',
            '“Hey, don’t worry!” said Margaret.A small group from the flock gathered around Abigail to find a solution. ',
            '“We could try nipping the wool off with our teeth,” suggested a young sheep in the group. ',
            '“Or you could rub really hard against the old tree at the end of the meadow! Maybe the wool would fall off on its own ?” said another. ',
            'But they knew none of these suggestions would cut Abigail’s wool properly. ',
            'Suddenly her older brother, Henry, came running over.She could always count on him. ',
            '“Look! The shepherd left his scissors in the front of the pen!” he said. “In a few minutes your wool will be as short as ours!”',
            'Everyone got excited.They tried to grab the big shears with their front hooves. ',
            '“Hmm, we better practice on the tall grass first!” said Henry.The shears were hard to control.But soon, he got the hang of it. ',
            'It took longer than usual and wasn’t as accurate as the shepherd’s haircut, but Abigail’s wool was finally short like the others.She felt much better. ',
            '“You’ve all been so helpful!” she said. “I know the perfect way to thank you.” Abigail the Sheep then led the group to her secret spot to share the juiciest daisies in the meadow.',

            'A little mouse lived in a tiny house, which she lovingly furnished with little things.Usually, her alarm clock went off early in the morning because she had a lot of things to do.',
            'But she hoped that this day would be different.',
            'The little mouse hopped out of her little bed, slipped into her robe and scurried to the big window.',
            '“Oh, how beautiful!” she thought. “The sun is shining and there isn’t a cloud in the sky.I’m going to use this day to finally do something really nice for myself.”',
            'She opened the window, took in a breath of summer air, and thought about what she could do with her day. ',
            '“I’d like to spend the day by the lake doing the things I really enjoy.That would be great!” she thought. ',
            'Just then, she was jolted from her thoughts by the hustle and bustle in her neighbor’s garden.She recognized Ulrich the Badger who looked like he was preparing for a garden party. ',
            '“Good morning, little mouse,” called Ullrich when he saw her. “Judging by your confusion, we must have forgotten to let you know that we’re having a big party today.There’s going to be a lot going on.We’d love it if you came, too, of course! Maybe you could bring your delicious apple pie that we all love so much ?” ',
            'The little mouse smiled and nodded.She looked at her watch and thought, “Well, it’s still early so I’ll have time to make it to the lake later.” ',
            'She hurried to eat her breakfast and wash her face so she could go to the market for the fresh apples and other ingredients she needed for the pie. ',
            'Once she had gotten the eggs, milk and apples, and placed them in the basket of her bicycle, she went home and set about preparing everything for the pie. ',
            'But as she did so, she remembered that she had lent her pie pan to the squirrel family. ',
            '“Oh dear, now I have to go out again!” she thought, annoyed. ',
            'In a flash, she jumped back on her bike and went to pick up the pan.Relieved that the squirrels were home, she turned to leave with her pan when one of the little squirrels called out to her. ',
            '“Can we show you our new swing ?” said the young squirrel.',
            'The mother squirrel looked at the little mouse expectantly and proudly.A few seconds later, the little mouse stood in the midst of the dray of squirrels and patiently allowed herself to be shown how their new swing worked and how to do the best somersaults. ',
            '“Again, again!” the children squealed.Then, before heading home, the little mouse read a story to each of the children. ',
            '“They are having so much fun,” the little mouse told herself, looking at the clock.It was getting late.With a heavy heart and a guilty conscience, she finally said goodbye to the family and hurried back to her cottage.',
            'She set about kneading the pie dough, peeling the apples and firing up the oven.Then she realized that there was not enough wood left for the stove, so she went out into the garden to look for branches and twigs and chop some smaller pieces of wood.',
            'The badger saw the mouse and said, “Oh good! We’re going to have a bonfire at the party.Could we have some of your wood ? I won’t have time to gather any today.” ',
            'The little mouse didn’t hesitate and handed her neighbor the wood she had just chopped. ',
            '“I’ll just gather some more for myself then,” she thought. ',
            'When the stove was heated and the pie was finally in the oven, she calculated that she could at least spend the afternoon at the lake.But first, all the dishes had to be washed. ',
            '“I really can’t leave the house like this,” she thought.So she set to work washing the bowls, spoons, plates and cups.Then the doorbell rang. ',
            '“Who could that be ?” thought the little mouse, looking at the clock. “Oh dear, it’s already three o’clock in the afternoon!” ',
            'Marie the Shrew was standing outside her door, carrying a picnic bag. “I’m just on my way to the lake and thought you might like to come along,” she said. ',
            'The little mouse looked into the kitchen and saw the sink full of soapy dishes and the timer on the stove. ',
            '“I wish I could but I have a pie in the oven so I can’t leave right now,” the little mouse said. ',
            '“Oh, too bad.I have to go now because the others are already there waiting for me.Maybe next time!” ',
            'The little mouse made her way back to the kitchen, thinking about what to wear to the party.Along the way, she took the delicious smelling pie out of the oven. ',
            'She found a colorful summer dress in her closet but it was very wrinkled.So she took out the ironing board and iron.',
            'When everything was finally ready, the mouse looked out of the window.The sun was already setting and the garden next door was getting louder. ',
            '“I guess my plans didn’t work out today,” the mouse thought sadly, dreaming about her planned day at the lake.'

            'A large flock of carrier pigeons lived on a small, rocky island in the middle of the rough Atlantic Ocean.They delivered important mail to the inhabitants of the surrounding islands. ',
            'One of the pigeons was named Betty.She liked to fool around and was easily distracted.When the pigeons made their daily flight over the island, Betty was often the last to arrive.Some of the other pigeons thought she was a dreamer and worried she wasn’t reliable. ',
            'When the weather was good, all the mail and many packages from the mainland and surrounding islands were loaded onto designated mail ships.But the weather was very variable in this region.During the frequent storms and high waves, the mail ships couldn’t dock in the ports of the small islands.That’s when the carrier pigeons would fly into action. ',
            'The island caretaker, William, fed and looked after the pigeons.He knew each one of them very well.He could assess a pigeon’s strengths and weaknesses quite accurately.There were particularly fast pigeons for short distances and others with the endurance to make long trips. ',
            'The most important thing was that they all reliably delivered the mail and returned safely to their island.There was always enormous joy at their reunions when they would all tell each other about their adventures. ',
            'On a particularly cool and windy day, the carrier pigeons were called up to replace the mail ship.It was a hectic atmosphere at the departure spot.Betty watched from the island’s observation tower as a number of carrier pigeons were getting ready for their journeys.William distributed the respective flight routes as usual. ',
            'Kevin and Scott were first in line.They were assigned thin brown envelopes strapped into pouches, and they waited patiently as William gently fastened them to their legs.',
            '“Kevin, this letter needs to get to the mainland as soon as possible.The journey may be somewhat arduous as strong winds are forecast.Plan for breaks but please come back as soon as possible,” William said, looking up at the gloomy sky. ',
            'Kevin nodded and William patted him on the head.Then he took off.He was hovering high above the island moments later and then he disappeared in the direction of the horizon.',
            'Then it was the next pigeon’s turn, and so on.Betty worried that she wouldn’t get an assignment since she had dawdled a bit last time and William had been very worried. ',
            'Then William called her name, “Here you are, Betty! You have a job waiting for you today, too,” William grinned. “It’s a little closer to home this time,” he said, winking at her.Betty beamed with pride. ',
            'She heard one of the pigeons behind her say, “I wonder how long Betty will take this time!” ',
            'Another replied as she was about to take off, “Coo, coo! She’s certainly not known for her speed!” ',
            'Betty knew exactly what the pigeons were getting at. “It’s not a contest!” she thought to herself.If they only knew what she went through on her flights! ',
            'She picked up a few more grains to fortify herself.William fastened the little bag to her leg and wished her a safe flight. ',
            'Betty liked her job.She loved getting to know the people to whom she delivered urgent mail.There was usually a lot of gratitude in their eyes.This made her very happy and proud. ',
            'Most of the time, the recipients even had a few tasty kernels of corn and a small bowl of water ready for her.After that, Betty would be reenergized for the flight home.She always had the nice feeling of having done a good deed.',
            'Betty read the name of the recipient on today’s envelope and was relieved to see that she already knew the way.From the roof of her dovecote, she spread her wings and took off with a skillful flourish. ',
            'How she loved to fly and feel the infinite freedom! With each beat of her wings, the landscape below her became smaller and the rocky island receded further into the distance.',
            'She was daydreaming as she flew when she was startled by a loud clatter and the sound of powerful wings.',
            'Just then, several storks flew past her, skillfully changing their positions.She called out to them, “Hey! You seem to be in quite a hurry.Where are you headed ?” ',
            'Betty didn’t know much about storks.Only that they traveled long distances and were much, much larger than pigeons.She could see that clearly now.',
            'Most of the storks paid no attention to her, but one of them seemed to be as curious as she was.This stork introduced herself, “I’m Stella and this is the second time I’ve flown this long distance.What’s your name ?”',
            'The two chatted happily for some time.Betty told Stella about the letters she was delivering and her experiences on various routes.Stella looked at her in amazement and said, “I’ve never heard of such a thing.It’s different for us storks…” ',
            'Now the little carrier pigeon listened intently to Stella’s stories.She said that the storks flew to the same place every year, that it is very warm there, and that the animals are different than here. ',
            '“There are giant elephants, and giraffes with very long necks, and zebras that look like horses but have black and white stripes.They all gather at the watering holes to quench their thirst,” Stella reported.',
            'She explained that many flocks of birds also gather at the watering holes to huddle together for warmth. “There are big birds that stand on one leg and have pink plumage! They are especially pretty.They’re called flamingos! Oh, why don’t you come with me, Betty ? You can drop off your letter on the way!” ',
            'Betty thought about it.It was very tempting. ',
            'She decided that she couldn’t pass up this opportunity and told Stella she’d be right back.She quickly took the letter to the small island that was now just below them.She picked up a few grains from a bowl and flew elegantly back up to the storks. ',
            'Stella offered her a place in the lee so she could rest a bit.The storks were very fast.',
            'Betty and Stella got along so well that they felt as though they had known each other forever.Stella told Betty all about the beautiful place called “Africa”. ',
            'Stella was a very animated storyteller.Her stories made Betty feel like she was there.Stella said that in Africa, even the sun seemed to be bigger and hotter.Betty could almost feel the warmth on her wings and see the elephants and flamingos at the watering hole.',
            'But Betty was getting tired.She was not used to long flights and desperately needed a rest.The storks weren’t even thinking about taking a break and the little carrier pigeon realized sadly that she wouldn’t make it through this long journey.',
            'Then she also remembered that William was probably very worried about her so she made a decision.',
            '“Stella,” Betty said. “Thank you for telling me so many interesting things about Africa on this trip.Your stories made me feel like I was there.I am very glad to have met you, but now I’m looking forward to going home again.”'

            '“Quite a mess,” she heard Mama mutter from the living room. ',
            '“But there’s no other way!” argued Emma. ',
            'She had discovered the elephant and the corresponding instructions in one of her favorite craft books and had decided to make it for Hanna for her birthday. ',
            'Her brother, Tim, was still too little to help out properly.Nevertheless, he played with the sticky paper and tried to glue them to the elephant with his little hands.',
            'Meanwhile, Charlie was comfortably rocking on his wooden pole by the kitchen window.Charlie was a blue budgie that Emma had received as a gift from her neighbor when she had become too old to continue taking care of him. ',
            '“He’s in good hands with you,” she had said to Emma at the time, hoping for Emma’s parents to agree.When they did, the neighbor was relieved and Emma finally had first pet to love and care for. ',

            'At the same moment, a colorful butterfly danced past the kitchen window.Charlie saw the elegant creature and jumped up from his swing.Mesmerized, he darted through a crack in the window and flew after it. ',

            'But Charlie could hardly keep up.They flew from one rooftop to the next. ',

            '“Charlie, Charlie, look the elephant is ready!” exclaimed Emma proudly as she ran back to the kitchen.She saw the empty wooden pole in the window and that her blue budgie was gone. ',

            'She spun around and searched the whole kitchen, bending down and crawling under the table.She looked in the cupboards and behind the door.But Charlie was nowhere to be seen.She glanced again at the window and noticed that it was open a crack. ',



            '“Mooooooooom!” cried Emma, running back into the living room.Sobbing, she explained that the window was open and that Charlie was gone.In a flash, everyone split up and searched the whole house. ',

            'Dad had also heard of Charlie’s disappearance and was on the lookout in the garden. ',

            '“I’ll go to the road now and see if Charlie is in one of the trees,” he said.',

            'He and Tim set off to search.But the blue budgie was nowhere to be found.When the sun set, they continued with a flashlight.Since Charlie was definitely not in the house, Mama and Emma had now also taken up searching along the road. ',

            '“We’ll have to give up the search for today, Emma,” said Mama. “It’s already far too dark and Charlie will most certainly have sought a safe and comfortable spot in one of the trees.We’ll continue in the morning.And tonight we’ll figure out how to get more help.”',

            'When Emma fell asleep that night she dreamed of Charlie.She saw him flying over the city looking for his home.All the houses and streets looked the same to him.Emma woke up and had an idea. ',

            '“I need to tell everyone in the neighborhood about Charlie’s disappearance,” she thought. “Then they can all watch their yards and search the treetops along the street.If they find Charlie, they can bring him back to me.After all, he’s blue so he’s easy to spot.” ',



            'She flicked on her bedside lamp and began drawing Charlie on a white sheet of paper.The next morning, Emma dashed down the stairs and showed her parents the flyer she had made.',

            '“That’s a great idea, Emma!” Dad said. “I’ll take today off and we can tape Charlie’s picture to trees, fences, doors and hedges around the neighborhood while we keep looking for him.” ',

            'Emma was relieved.After breakfast, her dad added some text to the picture she had made and put it into the scanner.It described what Charlie looked like and where he lived.As a finder’s reward, Emma offered a homemade chocolate cake and her whole allowance for that month. ',

            'Then they set off to hang flyers.They told every neighbor they met about Charlie too. ',

            'In the afternoon, all the flyers were distributed and Emma’s parents figured that now all they could do was wait and see.Emma was so exhausted that she plopped down on the sofa and asked for a hot chocolate. ',

            'For the next several days, many neighbors came forward and offered help, but none knew where Charlie was.Emma was glad to have school to distract her.Plus, she was also looking forward to Hanna’s birthday party which gave her some relief from worrying about Charlie. ',

            'The sheep also enjoyed the big field.They weren’t afraid of wolves because they all looked out for each other and Jacob counted them each morning.They snuggled together in the evenings and loved to look at the stars in the sky.They were happy to share their warm wool with the farmers each spring.

            'Three cats made sure that the farmers had no mice in their house.Harper didn’t like mice in the house at all.She stroked the cats and gave them fresh milk for keeping the mice away.',

            'All the other chickens regularly laid their eggs in their nests every day for Harper to collect.But Chloe liked to build her own nest in the tall grass or near the fence and lay her egg there.Then she would wrap a string around it and pull it with her beak to give to whoever she was visiting that day.',

            'Eventually, Chloe became bored of the farm.She had met everyone and desperately wanted to make new friends.So she decided she would go see what was happening on the other side of the fence.',

            'By now, the others on the farm had noticed that Chloe was missing.The rooster ran all over asking all the animals about the missing chicken.But no one had seen her all day.',

            'Charlotte’s grandparents, aunts and uncles, neighbors and mother had baked the most delicious variety of cakes and pies.Charlotte got to be the first to cut a cake and she chose her favorite: strawberry with a delicious cream cheese icing. ',

            '“This is my absolute favorite cake,” Charlotte said to her best friend. ',

            '“Then I want to try it too,” Lara replied. ',

            'When everyone had a piece of cake or pie of their choosing, the party felt like it had begun.Everyone was cheerful and enjoying the great weather.',

            'Suddenly, Charlotte’s little brother Liam jumped up.He dropped his fork and started running across the garden. ',

            '“What’s wrong with him ?” asked Lara. ',

            'Liam was now running around in circles screaming loudly.',

            'As Lara turned back to her piece of strawberry cake, she too started screaming.Sitting on her cake were two yellow and black striped insects, munching on her strawberries. ',

            '“Charlotte, get them off!” cried Lara.',



            'Everyone at the table was getting increasingly agitated as more and more of these yellow and black insects came to eat the sugary treats.They were also attracted to the delicious lemonades and a freshly prepared fruit salad.',

            'Charlotte’s mother was trying to calm the birthday guests and cover the cakes and treats so that their buzzing guests would fly away.',

            '“Mom, make the bees go away! They’re ruining my whole party!” yelled Charlotte, who was upset by all the chaos. ',

            '“Your buzzing guests aren’t bees; they’re wasps.Bees aren’t attracted to candy and cake.They are only interested in pollen and nectar,” Charlotte’s mother explained. ',

            '“I don’t really care whether they’re wasps or bees—they’re all equally stupid,” Charlotte grumbled.',



            'To save the birthday party, everyone was moved to the living room where they could eat and play in peace.',

            'Later, when the guests had said goodbye, Charlotte’s mother approached her.',

            '“Charlotte, you wished for the bees to disappear earlier today,” her mother started. “You are too young to understand the importance of bees, but in a few years, you will realize that bees play a very important role on this planet.” ',

            '“I don’t think so,” said Charlotte stubbornly. “Bees are annoying.They totally ruined my birthday today.”',

            'A few years later, Charlotte was celebrating her birthday again on a gorgeous summer day.She was turning 10 years old.Everyone was sitting at a beautifully set table in the garden. ',

            '“Mom, where is the strawberry cake I love so much ?” Charlotte asked.She had gotten her favorite cake every other year so far. ',

            '“I’m sorry sweetheart, but there are hardly any strawberries left,” she explained. “That’s why I couldn’t make your favorite cake this year.” ',

            '“But where did all the strawberries go ?” asked Charlotte.',

            '“Since there are hardly any bees left, the flowers from fruit trees and strawberry plants can no longer be properly pollinated,” Charlotte’s mom explained. “Therefore, many less large fruits grow and ripen and the harvest is very small and quickly used up.”',



            'Charlotte remembered her birthdays when there were enough strawberries and got worried. ',

            '“But if the bees are so important to us humans, then surely something must be done about it.The bees must be protected!” Charlotte said with conviction. “What can we do to help them ?”',

            '“Let’s go to the library to borrow a book about bees and find out how we can provide a place for them to live in our garden.If you care about bees, you could also do a presentation about them in geography class for your classmates.Maybe your teacher will think of something else to do to prevent their extinction too.”',

            'The next day, Charlotte passionately explained to her classmates how important the little insects are to people and that they had to work together to protect and save the bees.',

            'It was late summer and the last hot sun of the season had the neighborhood bustling with activity.',

            'Inspector Winston, a Dachshund with a talent for solving mysteries, was lying comfortably on a warm wooden bench near the garden wall.From here, he had a perfect view of both the house and the street so he could pick up a few exciting bits of conversation from the passers- by while making sure he didn’t miss any activity in the kitchen.His family was planning a barbecue for that night. ',

            '“The last barbecue of the season!” said his dad sadly.All Winston could think about was the chance that a piece of sausage might accidentally fall to the ground for him to clean up.',

            'Winston’s parents were busy in the kitchen preparing salads and appetizers.Just as they were discussing various sauces, Winston heard a loud scream from his neighbor’s garden. ',

            'He gallantly hopped off the garden bench onto the soft lawn to see if he could help.He crept up to the hedge and heard his neighbor, Mrs.Robertson, saying, “I don’t believe it! How can anyone be so clumsy ? My beautiful flowers!”',

            'Winston couldn’t see much through this section of the hedge.But there was a spot a little farther back where the hedge trimmer must have slipped and where the leaves were not as dense.Winston peered through to the neighbor’s yard.',

            'Mrs.Robertson was standing in the middle of the garden gesticulating wildly as she spoke to someone on her phone.At that moment, the school bus pulled up and several laughing children got off, keeping Winston from understanding exactly what she was saying to the person on the other end of the line. ',



            'A few seconds later, she hung up again and went inside the house through the patio door. ',

            '“What a commotion!” thought Winston. “This sounds like a new case for me to solve; and of all things, I missed the beginning!”',

            'Completely lost in his thoughts, Inspector Winston pondered various theories, wondering who could have gotten his neighbor so upset.He didn’t even notice when guests started to gather in his family’s garden.',

            'It wasn’t until someone leaned down to greet him by patting him on the head that he realized the barbecue had started.He resolved to pick the case back up the next day. ',



            'The next morning, Winston and his mom walked to the newsstand as they do every day.A group of children crowded around the ice cream counter while their parents talked about upcoming vacation plans.',

            'That’s when Winston spotted Mrs.Robertson taking the daily paper off the shelf and heading for the checkout.He looked up at his mom, who was preparing to buy a magazine.A few seconds later, the two women struck up a conversation in front of the checkout counter.',

            'Mrs.Robertson explained that the beautiful blooms on all her flowers had all been cut off in her garden.She suspected it had been the new gardener she had hired.She was getting too old to do it all herself. ',

            'All the buds on her wonderful perennial roses had been snapped off and the dahlias and cornflowers were bare. ',

            '“I put so much work into my garden and just like that, it’s all gone.Why would he do that ? He’s a real flower thief!” ',

            'People walking by slowed down to hear more about this so - called flower thief.Some whispered to one another. ',

            'Inspector Winston knew what to do. “I’m going to look into this gardener,” he thought.',

            'When they arrived back home, Winston made his way to the hedge that separated the two properties.There was a small hole he thought he might be able to squeeze through, but he’d never tried it before.',

            '“Well, if Mrs.Robertson’s well - fed cat can get through that hole, surely I’ll be able to!” thought Winston mischievously.And indeed he did.He pushed his way through the hedge and was on the other side in no time. ',



            'The neighbor’s garden was laid out quite differently from his own.It was also much neater.The flowers and plants were arranged by size—it was a work of art!',

            'But something was off.Suddenly, Winston could see how the rose bushes and beautifully grown perennial plants were all missing their flowers. ',

            'He really understood his neighbor’s frustration now. ',

            '“These plants have been robbed of their beauty!” he thought. “I’ll catch the flower thief in the act, I swear it!” Winston turned back to the hedge, slipped through the small hole, and waited for his opportunity the next day.',

            'Early in the morning, he was woken up by a loud noise.Curious, he jumped onto the window sill and poked his nose against the kitchen window.From this angle, he could make out Mrs.Robertson’s gardener using electric shears to cut the green plants. ',

            '“Aha! Caught in the act.And apparently he doesn’t even think it necessary to steal the flowers inconspicuously,” Winston thought. ',

            '“I’ve got the thief, I’ve got the thief!” he yelled.Inspector Winston barked so loudly that his dad fumbled down the stairs in his robe to see what was going on. ',

            '“What is it, Winston ?” he said. “First that deafening noise out there, and now you’re barking enough to wake the whole neighborhood.” ',

            'He went to the window as well and a few seconds later out the door.From there he could see the gardener, who was tending to the hedge. ',



            'But unlike Winston, he watched the gardener appreciatively. “Finally! Someone is taking care of this hedge.It’s nearly as tall as the house.”',

            'Satisfied, Winston’s dad came back into the kitchen and told his wife, who was now standing at the kitchen window, about the new gardener. ',

            '“I think we should hire him for our yard too.He could take a look at the bushes in front of the house!” he said. ',

            'Winston was disappointed. ',

            '“It doesn’t seem to be the gardener after all.But then, who is the flower thief ?” he wondered.',

            'For the rest of the day, Inspector Winston listened carefully.He tried to catch details from conversations on the street and casually listen to Mrs.Robertson’s telephone calls.He also questioned some neighborhood animals. ',

            'While he would usually prefer not to engage a cat in conversation, in this case, it had to be done.Unfortunately, Mrs.Robertson’s cat claimed not to know anything about the missing flowers. ',

            'Winston talked to a budgie that was usually on the wooden walkway by the window across the street who didn’t have any answers.Next, he would talk to the squirrel who, for several days, had been jumping from one tree to the next in the neighborhood to collect food for the winter. ',

            '“Hey you!” shouted Winston towards the squirrel who was high up in the tree. “Did you happen to see who stole the blossoms from Mrs.Robertson’s flower bed ?”',

            'The squirrel shook his head and assured Winston that he had not seen a flower thief during the day.He wasn’t around at night though. ',



            '“I see!” said Winston. “So no thief was sighted during the day but it seems the garden is unattended at night.” ',

            'Winston had thought that cats were fond of roaming around in the dark, but Mrs.Robertson’s cat said she hadn’t seen anything.Winston wondered if she was telling the whole truth. ',

            'He decided to keep an eye on the garden himself that night so he took a nap in the afternoon.Unfortunately, he didn’t wake up until everyone else was asleep. ',

            'There was a rustling sound outside.He remembered the flower thief and snapped to attention.',

            'He carefully opened the door and crept out of the house and over to the hedge.Someone was in Mrs.Robertson’s garden! It sounded like they were eating. ',

            'He carefully stuck his snout through the narrow hole in the hedge and couldn’t believe what he saw.It wasn’t a thief stealing the flowers from Mrs.Robertson after all.It was a deer foraging for dinner.  ',

            '“What on earth are you doing ?” said Winston, barking louder than he intended.This startled the deer so much that he trampled several more flowers flat in fright. ',

            '“Hey! Watch out!” Winston continued. “You’ve ruined the whole flower bed! My neighbor has been beside herself for days because her beloved garden has been destroyed!”',

            'The deer looked sad. “I didn’t mean to ruin the flower bed! You startled me.I didn’t know anyone had gone to that much trouble with these flowers either…” ',



            'The deer lowered his eyes.Winston didn’t think he seemed like a thief at all. ',

            '“Where did you come from ? I’ve never seen you here before,” said Winston. ',

            'The deer explained that he lived in the forest but that a few days ago a fence had gone up for a construction site.There were excavators and big, noisy vehicles working all the time.Frightened, he had run away and gotten lost in the city.He was having trouble finding food.  ',

            'Just then, the squirrel came down from the tree and said, “I know the fence you mean.If you want, I can show you a way to get back to the forest safely.Then you can stop stealing people’s flowers.Plus, it’s too dangerous for a deer in the city!” ',

            'Winston agreed with the squirrel and the deer seemed relieved.Winston waved to the deer and watched him walk away with the squirrel. ',

            'He looked at his neighbor’s flowers and thought, “Good thing flowers grow back and thieves aren’t always thieves!”',

            'Early one morning, Richard the Meerkat was making his way to the river where all the animals liked to cool off before the water evaporated in the summer. ',

            'He jumped from one boulder to the next, chatted to a few antelopes and then looked for a nice spot to watch the sunrise.He found a comfortable rock, took some fruit out of his rucksack, and nibbled on it with relish. ',

            'Suddenly Richard’s attention was caught by something shiny and sparkly in the water. ',

            '“What could that be ?” he wondered. “It’s probably just the sun reflecting off an old tin can through the water.” ',

            'But no matter how hard he tried to ignore it and concentrate on his breakfast, Richard’s curiosity about the shiny object could not be ignored.He stalked carefully along the riverbank, skillfully hopping from one boulder to the next, always careful not to get his fur wet. ',

            'Once down on the sandy shore, he stretched his neck out further to get as close as possible to the glittering object.He looked around several times and was relieved to see that he was all alone. ',

            'With a quick, skillful movement, he fished the object out of the water in a flash and could hardly believe his eyes.He was holding a beautiful blue gemstone. ',

            '“What a gorgeous stone,” Richard thought to himself as he happily made his way home. ',



            'He was mesmerized by the shine and cut.He couldn’t take his eyes off it.He didn’t think he had seen anything more beautiful in the whole world. ',

            '“Everyone should see that it belongs to me,” he thought. ',

            'When he got home, he dug out an old leather cord from a chest of drawers and quickly attached the blue stone to it.Then he stood in front of the mirror and put on the necklace. ',

            '“The others won’t be able to take their eyes off me,” he thought.He was looking forward to the start of school like never before. ',

            'The next morning, Richard made his way to school early.He wanted to be the first one in the schoolyard so everyone would see him and admire his necklace. ',



            'And indeed, a wildebeest, an antelope, a leopard and two monkeys came running into the schoolyard with a soccer ball.They ran towards Richard when they spotted him. ',

            '“What’s that beautiful stone on your necklace ?” one of the two monkeys asked immediately.They could hardly take their eyes off of it.',

            'The leopard circled his classmate and also enquired about the stone. ',

            '“If I’m not mistaken, it’s a blue sapphire.Where did you get such a magnificent treasure ?” he said, not taking his eyes off Richard and the blue stone. ',

            'Richard had no idea that it was a sapphire and put the leopard off. “Oh, it’s a long story.I’ll tell you another time.”',

            '“How about today after school ?” the leopard called out, but Richard had already disappeared into the school building. ',

            'The bell rang for the start of lessons and Richard had to hurry.He was very excited to see what his two best friends, Jasper the Lion and Susan the Zebra, would think about the special stone. ',

            'Richard made his way to his classroom full of expectation.He was one of the last students to enter the classroom. ',

            'He felt the many eyes on him and his necklace as he took his seat.But his two friends were hardly paying any attention to his special treasure.',

            'Instead, Jasper whispered anxiously: “Richard, where were you this morning ? We couldn’t find you anywhere.” ',



            'Susan also looked at him questioningly. ',

            'After class, the two approached him, but even then they didn’t look at the stone.Disappointed and a little annoyed, Richard joined his other classmates in the schoolyard. ',

            'Over the next few days, Richard was a changed meerkat.He enjoyed the full attention and admiration of his classmates.He even forgot Susan’s birthday and missed Jasper’s long jump competition.The two of them had trained together for months.Richard didn’t seem to notice that he no longer had any time for his best friends.',

            'A short time later, as it was getting hotter and hotter in the savannah, Richard made his way back to the river. ',

            '“Before the river dries up and reveals its treasures to everyone,” he thought, “I want to see if I can find a second sapphire.Where there’s one treasure, there might be another.” ',

            'Full of hope, he hopped from one boulder to the next.This time, however, he was not as careful.He slipped on a wet rock and fell into the water.He struggled, trying to keep his head out of the raging river to avoid drowning.He yelled and stretched his arms up in the hope that someone would hear him.',

            ' Nearby, Jasper and Susan were watching the hippos play water polo.Suddenly Susan heard a loud and shrill scream. ',

            '“Jasper!” she gasped. “Someone’s calling for help!”',

            'They dashed off and saw their friend Richard struggling in the river from a distance.The two didn’t hesitate for long before throwing an old rope into the current and calling out to Richard to hold on tight. ',



            'Together they managed to pull him out of the raging river.Once he was safely on the shore, he frantically felt his chest fur with his paws, but the necklace with the sapphire was gone. ',

            '“It’s gone forever, isn’t it ?” Richard asked his two friends sadly.They looked at each other hesitantly. ',

            '“We’ll help you find it again,” said Jasper and together they wandered along the entire river for hours. ',

            'Just as they were about to give up, Susan shouted, “Up ahead! I think I can see it.” ',

            'And indeed, the sapphire was hanging, seemingly unharmed, from its leather strap in a thorn bush, swinging dangerously close to the surface of the river. ',

            'Using a long branch, Richard managed to get the stone.Beaming with joy, he put the chain back around his neck and skipped home with his friends, happy and cheerful. ',

            'When he was home, he set off in search of a heavy, sharp - edged stone.He placed the sapphire on the floor and let the heavy stone fall onto it.The sapphire shattered into three pieces and Richard went to sleep relieved and content.',

            'The next morning, the three friends met in front of the school building as they used to.',

            '“I have a little present for you,” he said with a grin.When the two of them opened the gifts, they each saw a small blue stone on a leather cord. ',

            'Winston the Dachshund was snoozing in the morning sun when he heard Mrs.Robertson’s excited voice coming from the kitchen.She was sitting by the window, holding up the daily newspaper so that her delicate figure was almost completely hidden behind it.',

            '“If you didn’t know she was sitting there,” Winston thought to himself, “you’d think the newspaper was talking.” ',

            'From his cozy spot in the hallway, he watched with amusement as Mrs.Robertson desperately tried to tame the many crackling and rustling pages in order to fold them back into their original state.',

            'Finally, she placed the newspaper neatly on the kitchen table next to a slice of jam roll and teacup.Only then did Mrs.Robertson notice Winston’s curious look.',

            '“Oh Winston, if only you knew,” she said. “The things that have been happening in this place lately… hard to imagine.Those beautiful jewels.It really is a tragedy!”',

            'Mrs.Robertson took a sip of tea, took another bite of her jam roll and began to clear the table, lost in thought. ',

            '“Jewels ? In this small town ?” he wondered. “And what could have happened to them ?” It felt like Winston’s head was starting to spin.',

            'He was still pacing back and forth, lost in thought, which was making Mrs.Robertson nervous.She had been watching the restless dachshund for a quarter of an hour and found his behavior very strange. ',

            '“Maybe he didn’t eat breakfast ?” Worried about the dachshund’s condition, she decided to call Winston’s parents in Italy as a precaution.',

            '“Please excuse the interruption,” she said when his father answered. “You’re supposed to be relaxing in Italy.Is it as nice and warm as you hoped ?”',

            'Mrs.Robertson tried to keep calm during the conversation, but her neighbor could tell that something was wrong. ',

            '“Is everything all right with you and Winston ?” he asked.',

            '“You won’t believe what happened here in town last night!” Mrs.Robertson explained. “All the jewels were stolen from the old town museum.Now they’re probably gone forever.And the worst part is that nobody knows who did it or how they broke into the museum in the first place.It’s under surveillance day and night!” ',

            'Now that she was talking, she couldn’t stop. ',

            '“And I’m also worried about Winston,” she said. “He’s behaving rather strangely this morning, pacing and not settling down at all.I suspect he didn’t eat his breakfast.I made him an egg, was that wrong ?”',

            'Winston’s father tried to reassure Mrs.Robertson. “You certainly didn’t do anything wrong with the breakfast egg.On the contrary! If I know my dachshund, it was a real treat.In fact, I suspect he’s just as upset by the news as you are!” ',

            'There was silence on the line for a moment.Mrs.Robertson was about to remind him that Winston was only a dog, but stopped when she saw Winston’s head peeking around the door frame.',

            '“You’d almost think he understood us…” she whispered. ',

            'Now Winston’s father was worried about Mrs.Robertson and asked her to keep calm for the time being.He reassured her that his dog was certainly fine and that he would be back in two days.Until then, she shouldn’t worry. ',

            'After the conversation, Mrs.Robertson dropped into her wingback chair.',

            'Meanwhile, Winston sat down on the steps that led down to Mrs.Robertson’s small garden and let the warm wind blow through his shaggy fur.He dozed off thinking about what it was like in Italy. ',

            'He missed his father and briefly wondered whether he shouldn’t have gone along after all.But he quickly came to the conclusion that he would then have missed the mysterious jewel robbery. ',

            'Just then, he was torn from his thoughts by something shiny up in the sky.He could hear a soft clinking sound in the wind and realized it was being held in the beak of a bird. ',

            'He couldn’t see what kind of bird it was, only that it was heading straight for Mrs.Robertson’s old apple tree.When the bird landed, Winston made his way over.He sat down under the tree and barked loudly a few times.The bird looked down from the branch. ',

            '“Aha, a magpie,” Winston thought to himself and wondered what the glittery thing was that had just been transported to the nest. “I’ll be sure to keep an eye on you, after all, magpies are said to have a certain preference for shiny things.” ',

            'Winston spent the whole afternoon in Mrs.Robertson’s garden watching the magpie tirelessly transport objects to her nest. ',

            '“Are you the thief we’ve been looking for?” he wondered. “I’ll find out in time.I’ll have to set a trap for you.” ',

            'Winston devised a plan to trick the magpie.He wandered through the house and searched for shiny objects.And sure enough, in Mrs.Robertson’s bedroom he discovered several pearl necklaces and a bracelet with shiny ornaments. ',

            '“Mrs.Robertson would certainly never forgive me for risking her jewelry…” he thought.',

            'Looking for another idea, he let his gaze wander around the room one last time and then smiled. ',

            '“I’ve got it!” He walked to the chest of drawers on which a few craft items and scraps of fabric lay.There was a beautiful silver tiara with colorful, glittering stones glued to it. ',

            'He knew that the tiara wasn’t real because Mrs.Robertson was passionate about carnival and had been working on her costumes. ',

            '“I’m sorry Mrs.Robertson,” he thought. “It’s a nice tiara but I’ll have to use you to catch the thief.” ',

            'Winston grabbed the tiara with his snout and positioned it by the kitchen window.He was pleased to see that the sun’s rays made the tiara sparkle in a number of beautiful colors. ',

            '“Now I just have to open the window and wait,” Winston thought confidently.',

            'He lay down in his basket on the kitchen floor and watched the window.But the warm rays of sunshine also made Winston very tired.His eyes became heavier and he fell asleep and began dreaming. ',

            'A while later, he was startled awake.He rushed to the open window and saw that the tiara was gone.He stuck his head out and saw the magpie flying away. ',

            'But this time the sun was so blinding that Winston couldn’t see exactly what she was carrying in her beak. ',



            'Annoyed by his unexpected nap, Winston called out: “You’ve been caught red - handed, you thieving magpie! Whoever stole this tiara probably stole the real jewels!”',

            'At that moment, Mrs.Robertson entered the kitchen with a bunch of tulips. “The sun’s finally making an appearance again, isn’t it Winston ?” she said.',

            'She picked out a vase, placed the tulips on the table and then asked: “What do you say we take a walk to the museum today in this beautiful weather ? The whole town is talking about the robbery.Maybe we’ll find something out!” ',

            'Winston was delighted.He wouldn’t have expected Mrs.Robertson to be so curious, but her interest in the case worked well for him. ',

            '“I can finally start my investigation at the crime scene,” he thought happily.',

            'Now, as Inspector Winston, he who would take a close look around the museum and carefully scrutinize the scene of the crime.His plan was to prove it was the thieving magpie and perhaps even catch him in the act of another robbery. ',

            'Once at the museum, he looked closely at the large, bright room.He discovered a glass display case that was closed off with red plastic tape.A note with a photo was attached to it. ',

            '“Look at that!” Mrs.Robertson said softly. “So this is where they were… the beautiful jewels.” ',

            'Winston looked at the photo and imagined the magpie flying in the sky, laden with a heavy bag of museum jewels.But when he looked at the photo again he realized that the stolen jewels might be a bit too heavy for a bird like the magpie.',



            'He looked around the room and noticed that there were no windows or ventilation shafts that the magpie could have used to make her escape either. ',

            'At that moment, he became aware of a clanking noise.It was quiet and apparently the human museum visitors couldn’t hear it.Mrs.Robertson was quietly looking at a painting on the wall. ',

            'Winston became curious and followed his fine canine hearing, which was far superior to that of the humans.He walked along the corridor unnoticed and turned left into the hall.Even from a distance, he could see a shadow on the wall. ',

            'He stalked silently and very carefully, then peered around the corner and… he saw a museum employee standing at the display case. ',

            'Winston recognized the uniform that all the museum guards wore here.He had been here before with his father to see art exhibits.',

            '“Oh, nevermind,” Winston thought. “Something’s probably just broken and the employee is replacing it.” ',

            'Surely Mrs.Robertson had also noticed by now that she had lost her dachshund. ',

            '“The old lady doesn’t need any more excitement,” he thought and started to turn back.But there was the noise again.It clanked and rattled even more loudly now. ',

            'He turned around again and saw the man tipping all the silver coins, some shiny cups and trophies from the display case into a brown velvet sack and then stuffing it into a rucksack.A few pieces fell to the ground, which he tried to gather up again quickly.',



            'The man turned around, visibly agitated, and apparently checked whether anyone might have been watching him.Then he took his phone out of his pocket and Inspector Winston heard him say: “I’ve got everything now.I’ll bring the delivery right over.” ',

            'Then he hung up, closed his rucksack and walked quickly toward the exit. ',

            'Winston didn’t have much time now.He frantically thought about what to do next and decided to bark as loud as he could.His plan worked.',

            ' Mrs.Robertson was already looking for him and ran as fast as she could towards the loud barking.The other museum visitors also became aware of the sudden noise and gathered in the corridor. ',

            'When Mrs.Robertson finally reached the dachshund, she said nervously: “Winston, please stop barking! What’s going on ?”',

            'Winston had been waiting for this opportunity.He sprinted after the man, barked and yelped again as loudly as he could and then jumped up at the man’s rucksack.The man tried to shake him off. ',

            'Winston heard Mrs.Robertson call out in embarrassment: “Winston! Please leave the poor museum attendant alone.This isn’t like you!” ',

            'She was just about to pull the dachshund back by the collar when the man’s rucksack fell to the ground with a loud clatter, causing everyone to cover their ears.',

            'A few coins rolled towards a museum employee and landed with a loud clink.She had interrupted her tour because of all the commotion and rushed over. ',



            '“Those are the Roman silver coins!” she said. “What are they doing in your rucksack ? Who are you anyway ?” ',

            'The zipper of the rucksack had burst open and, in addition to the silver coins, they could all see the valuable trophies and cups from the display case.',

            'Mrs.Robertson put two and two together in her mind and said loudly: “You are the jewel thief we’ve been looking for!”',

            'The next moment, an employee pressed the alarm button on the nearby pillar and all the exits to the museum were automatically locked.Escape was now impossible until the police arrived.The dachshund looked up at Mrs.Robertson with satisfaction. ',

            'Back at home, both Mrs.Robertson and Winston were exhausted from the exciting afternoon.Mrs.Robertson was full of praise for Winston.In the end, the thief was only found and caught thanks to his excellent ears.',

            'As a reward for the dachshund, she took a few sausages and placed them on the wooden bench under the old apple tree. ',

            '“Come here, Winston!” she called happily to the dachshund. “You’ve really earned these treats today!” She proudly patted him on the head and they enjoyed the warm afternoon sun. ',

            'Once again, their attention was caught by something shiny.Mrs.Robertson got up from the bench and picked up some sparkling scraps of silver foil from the lawn.There was also a silver tin can and a few strips of old tinsel. ',

            'She looked up at the old apple tree. “Look at Winston.The magpie seems to be busy padding her nest up there.The way it shines in the sun, you’d almost think it was fine jewelry!”',
            'Amused, Mrs.Robertson collected the magpie’s treasures and placed them carefully on a tree stump. “Maybe she can still use them,” she said to Winston.',

            'The dachshund looked at the kitchen window, which was still open, and then spotted the tiara on the lawn. “So the magpie hadn’t stolen the tiara after all.It must have been carried off the window sill by a gust of wind,” Winston thought. ',

            'He looked up into the treetops and watched the magpie as she tirelessly fixed something in her nest with her beak. “I’m sorry, dear magpie.I was wrong! You aren’t a thief after all.”',

            '            In a small kingdom surrounded by a dense forest, a king lived with his only daughter in a beautiful castle.Her full name was Jessica Madison Abigail Elizabeth, Princess of Woodland, but most people just called her “Jessie.”',
            '        Since Jessie was the king’s only daughter, and because he loved her more than anything in the world, he fulfilled her every wish.He was a good- natured king and he wanted his beloved child to grow up as happy as possible.',
            '        Unfortunately, the exact opposite happened.Princess Jessie became conceited and spoiled.She wasn’t happy unless she had everyone’s full attention.If her wishes were not immediately fulfilled, her mood instantly worsened. ',
            'She was rude to all of the servants, rarely even spoking to them in complete sentences.She was unreasonable too, like when she demanded ice cream with fresh strawberries in the dead of winter when there was no fresh fruit to be found.',
            'Jessie was actually a sweet girl, but because she had always gotten everything she wanted, she had learned to expect the impossible and didn’t respect people’s work.One day she demanded a pink dress embroidered with yellow diamonds, and the very next day she found the color yellow unsatisfying and demanded they all be replaced with red gem stones.',
            '    Eventually, Princess Jessie became just plain bored.No one ever denied her a single wish.Jessie could think of nothing more to do with her time because the more things she wished for, the less fun it was to do anything with them.',
            'When the king noticed that his daughter was becoming unhappy and spiritless, he ordered a golden carriage to drive her every day through the beautiful forest.He hoped this would excite her and keep her cheeks rosy from the fresh air, as befitted a princess.',
            'One day, Jessie was particularly grumpy.Nothing pleased her: the food didn’t taste good, her beautiful pink dress suddenly scratched her neck, and even the golden carriage was not comfortable enough for the bumpy road through the forest.',
            'She looked out of the carriage’s gold - framed window, dissatisfied and indifferent.Suddenly, something flashed past her window.It was a white creature that left a beautiful, glittering rainbow trail in its wake.It quickly dashed behind a tree.Jessie ordered the coachman to stop and ran towards the rainbow, but it dissipated by the time she reached it.Curious, she tiptoed further into the dense forest.',
            '“What could that creature have been ?” she wondered.Jessie had never seen anything so beautiful. “I want to see it again right now!” she said and she stamped her dainty foot on the forest floor.That’s how she always got things she wanted back at the castle.',
            'She looked behind every tree, but found nothing.Not even a footprint in the mud.She walked a little more and caught sight of a clearing bathed in a wondrous, bright light.There, standing in the middle of the clearing, was the white creature. ',
            'Was it a horse ? Jessie compared it to the royal horses pulling her carriage… No! It was no ordinary horse.It had a big white horn on its head that shone in the light like a crystal.The princess had never seen such a creature before, although she knew many animals of the forest quite well. ',
            '“Who are you ?” Jessie called to the animal into the clearing. ',
            '“I am a unicorn,” said the creature. “And I’m lost! Your golden carriage shone so brightly in the sun that I followed it all the way here.” ',
            'Jessie noticed that the beautiful unicorn was sad. ',
            '“I am supposed to meet the other unicorns but I can’t find my way back,” the unicorn explained.',
            '“What are you meeting for and where are you trying to go ?” asked Princess Jessie. ',
            '“All unicorns meet regularly at a secret place that you humans don’t know about.There, young unicorns, like me, are taught by a great wizard.He teaches us how to be unicorns and how to get the power to shine and glow so beautifully.I really can’t be late!”',
            'Jessie realized her mouth was open.She was dazzled by the beauty of this creature.She desperately wanted to pet the unicorn.But the unicorn refused her.Princess Jessie became annoyed. ',
            '“This forest belongs to my father, the King of Woodland! You are in our kingdom and you have to obey me!” she said forcefully.',
            'The unicorn became pale. “You’re very unkind, I don’t like you.Not every creature has to obey you just because your father is a king.Unicorns are very peaceful and friendly beings!” With that, the wondrous creature disappeared, leaving behind a glittering trail of mist. ',
            'Jessie was quite perplexed.It was the first time in all her life that someone had disobeyed her.',
            'When she returned to the royal palace, she demanded that her father capture the strange unicorn for her. “Father, I really want to possess this glittering magical creature.It looks so wonderful!” ',
            'The king replied, “Dear Jessie, I would love to do that for you.Only, for once, I can’t grant you your wish.Magical creatures cannot be captured.Their attention must be earned.” ',
            'Jessie went to her room to think this over.',
            'Each time she went out into the forest, Jessie visited the clearing, hoping to see the unicorn again.She tried to lure it with treats, but the unicorn wouldn’t show up.',
            'At night, she dreamed of riding through the forest on the unicorn’s white back and being allowed to attend the unicorns’ secret gatherings.She couldn’t stop thinking about how the unicorn said they all treated each other politely and kindly. ',
            'One night, the dream changed.Jessie suddenly saw herself in her dream, yelling at one of the servants and being rude to the dressmakers.When she woke up she could not go back to sleep.She reflected all night and made a firm resolution to be a better princess.',
            'The next morning, she got up early and put on the plainest dress she owned.She ran down the many stairs to the dining room and sat down at the huge table that was set just for her, as usual.Jessie realized she wasn’t hungry at all and ran into the kitchen. ',
            '“Good morning, Catherine! You don’t have to make me breakfast today.An apple and a glass of milk is quite enough for me this morning.” ',
            'The kitchen employees could hardly believe their ears.Jessie grabbed the apple and milk and hurried out.',
            'Then she met the coachman, who was already feeding the horses and getting them ready for her ride in the forest. ',
            '“Hello Benjamin, may I help you feed the horses ?” she asked.Before Benjamin could answer, one of the horses took a big bite out of Jessie’s apple. ',
            'Jessie laughed. “This is really fun!” she exclaimed.',
            'The princess took it upon herself to make the dressmakers’ lives a little easier too.They sometimes worked for days on the princess’s special requests and almost never received any attention.Jessie had seen a beautiful meadow on her last outing and went to pick a big bouquet full of colorful flowers for them. ',
            '“I can’t wait to see if they like them,” Jessie thought.',
            'Jessie took her daily carriage ride through the forest as usual.It was only when she no longer expected to see the wondrous magical creature ever again, that the unicorn appeared in the clearing.This time it came very close to her.She could feel its stardust on her skin and smell its unique floral scent.She was incredibly excited.',
            'The unicorn knelt down in front of Jessie to let her climb on its back.Jessie was completely speechless, but happier than she had ever been.They rode silently through the forest as if on velvet hooves, wrapped in a cloud of fine silver dust.The unicorn showed the princess a silver lake; the unicorns’ secret meeting place.The rainbow behind the lake was reflected in the water.It was beautiful.Jessie felt like she was magical too!',
            'She understood that being allowed to ride to the unicorns’ secret meeting place was a great sign of trust.She knew that she had to carefully guard and keep this secret.At that moment, a deep friendship began between the two that would change the princess’ life forever.',
            'At the royal palace, Jessie was unrecognizable.The castle’s staff was amazed at her transformation.She never lost her temper anymore, she took very loving care of the animals, and she was never rude to an employee again.',
            'Of course, the king also noticed the change in his daughter.He smiled because he was proud of her.Now he knew that his beloved girl would become a good queen one day! ',
            '“Almost like magic…” he thought to himself and smiled towards the forest clearing.',

            '“I must find the moon before the inhabitants of Earth notice,” thought the sun.But everyone the sun asked didn’t know where the moon and the stars had gone.And everywhere the sun looked, the moon wasn’t there.',

            'Jeffrey the Seagull went to the beach to look for shells and lugworms in the bright sunshine.There were always many in this area.',
            'To find them, however, you needed good eyes, some skill and a lot of experience.In addition to lugworms, the Wadden Sea also had small and large crabs, shrimp, as well as various fish and types of mussels. ',
            'The best places to look were in the damp mudflats or the tideway when the tide was low and these creatures were waiting for the next tide to wash them back into the sea. ',
            'Once he had found some mussels, Jeffrey flew around to find a suitable spot to crack them open and eat them with relish.Perhaps he would also spot a lugworm or two. ',
            'Jeffrey headed for a high wooden post that was very close to the sandbank.Here he rested as the fresh North Sea wind brushed his strong plumage.',
            'From his perch, he watched with amusement as a small group of people seemed to be getting a very detailed explanation of how to find a lugworm.They were probably being told that there was nothing to fear from the curled piles on the mudflats. ',
            'Jeffrey had often seen tourists walking in zigzag lines through the mudflats because they didn’t want to step on them. ',
            '“Completely harmless!” thought Jeffrey. “It’s just digested sand.”',
            'Amused, he continued to watch as one of the people, presumably the mudflat guide, poked around in the bottom of the mudflat with a long stick and then try to fish out a crab in the tidewater. ',
            '“Works for me!” thought Jeffrey. ',
            'This way he could watch as the tourists lured out his next meal.Once the people were gone, all Jeffrey had to do was pick it up. ',
            'As the group moved toward the beach, Jeffrey’s gaze roamed from the shell bank across the entire area to the horizon.He could already hear the rushing tide making its way further and further down the beach.',
            'He was surprised to see that a small group of children was still quite far out.They were apparently busy building substantial sand castles.Jeffrey noticed that a lot of tidewater was already flowing through. ',
            '“Where are the parents of the busy builders ?” he wondered.But he couldn’t see any adults anywhere.He cracked a tightly closed shell, gobbled it up faster than he had planned to, and flew off. ',
            'He wanted to take a closer look at how far the tide had really progressed and how long it would take for the water to reach the children. ',
            'Someone who didn’t know the area would most likely misjudge the situation.The water could look shallow with very gentle waves but it was treacherous not to be able to judge this danger correctly.',
            'Jeffrey could see now that there wasn’t much time.After all, the kids would have to walk a fair distance before they were back to safety!',
            'Jeffrey flapped his wings vigorously and soared elegantly through the blue sky until he arrived at the children.At first he tried to circle the group, drawing attention to himself with his screech. ',
            'The children, however, were not impressed and continued to build undisturbed.So Jeffrey made a second attempt.He flew at full speed and dived towards one of the castles. ',
            'He just managed to lift his body at the last second and take off again towards the sky.One of the children shouted, “Hey what was that ? That’s our castle!” Another child hid as Jeffrey was already on his second approach. ',
            '“At least I got their attention!” he thought to himself.Now on the second flight maneuver, even the children realized that Jeffrey was trying to tell them something. ',
            '“What’s wrong with this seagull ?” said one of the older kids. “We don’t have anything for you to eat here!” ',
            'Jeffrey decided to make a final attempt.He was sure that the children would watch him now so he flew from the sand castle to the ever - approaching tide.There he landed in the cool water, spinning and making as many eddies as possible, and then flew back to the children, drenched.',
            'If Jeffrey could talk to them, he would have said something like, “Don’t you see how close the water has already come ?” ',
            'The children, however, found the spectacle quite entertaining and were apparently also no longer worried that he might take another nosedive at one of their castles. ',
            'Now there was only one thing left to do.He landed right next to the children.He would never usually get this close to people voluntarily.But if he wanted to help them he had no choice. ',
            'He quickly grabbed one of the children’s sand shovels and flew off. ',
            'He didn’t know who the parents were or in which of the countless beach chairs they might be sitting.',
            'Besides, Jeffrey wasn’t at all sure that the parents would understand his message, since they didn’t seem to know much about tides.Instead, Jeffrey flew to the rescue station.',
            'Here, everyone knew the rules of nature and the danger of the tides.When he arrived, he realized why no one had spotted the castle - building kids yet.A huge frozen foods delivery truck that was bringing ice cream to the kiosk blocked the view. ',
            'Jeffrey slammed the red plastic scoop against the front window of the hut.It was loud enough that the two lifeguards in charge immediately ran outside. ',
            '“The seagulls are getting weirder and weirder,” one said. ',
            'But now Jeffrey made a few turns in the air and flew off again with the scoop.The lifeguards’ curiosity was piqued.They took their binoculars and followed him. ',
            'When they came around the delivery truck and saw the children, they blew their whistles and began running.',
            'Exhausted, Jeffrey dropped the red shovel back near the children.From a distance, he saw a crowd of adults running in their direction. ',

            'One day, Jason took a big bite of an apple and one of his teeth got stuck in it.He was filled with dread. ',
            '“What happened to my tooth ? I have a gap now.Will I get a new tooth ?” Jason asked.',
            'Thankfully, his mom was there to help him calm down.She explained that a bigger and stronger tooth would grow back in its place.This new tooth would stay forever, provided it was cleaned properly.',
            '“If you want, you can show your baby tooth to the tooth fairy!” suggested Jason’s mom. ',
            '“What’s a tooth fairy ? And what is she going to do with my tooth ?” Jason asked.He had become curious.But his mom told him to be patient and he would find out for himself.',
            'So Jason decided to part with his tooth.That night, he put it in a little box by the window before bed.Then he waited.He had resolved to stay awake until he could see the tooth fairy with his own eyes. ',
            '“I wonder what she looks like.And how she gets into my room.” The more questions Jason had, the more sleepy he became.',
            'He fell asleep and missed the arrival of the tooth fairy. ',
            'When he woke up, his tooth was gone.Instead, there was a small note in the box. ',
            '“Mom, my baby tooth is gone!” he said excitedly. “But there is a note in its place!” ',
            'His mother rushed over to read the note to him.',
            'Dear Jason, I am the tooth fairy and I found your baby tooth tonight.Thank you for this great gift.The first tooth a child loses is always the most precious.I want to give you something in return.Listen carefully.Do you see the many stars in the sky at night ? I will take each of your baby teeth and turn them into stars in the sky.But for this to work, they must shine brightly so they can be seen from afar.Make sure you always clean your teeth well and put your lost teeth in this box for me.In return, I will give you dreams about the most exciting adventures you can imagine! ',
            'Now Jason could hardly wait to lose his next tooth.But until then, he made sure to take care of his teeth so they would shine.Every evening, as he happily brushed his teeth, he looked out the window at the stars twinkling in the sky.',

            'One beautiful, sunny day, a small grasshopper was sitting in a lush meadow.He felt very safe in his surroundings because he was the same shade of bright green as the grass around him.He lazily watched as bumblebees and colorful butterflies danced from one fragrant flower to another around him. ',
            'Then the grasshopper noticed a small field mouse.He was very restless and nervous - looking.He kept looking behind his back and to the sides and was constantly looking for a new hiding place.The grasshopper realized it was because the mouse was afraid of the fox that roamed the meadow.',
            '“No one will discover me here!” the grasshopper shouted. “When I sit on a blade of grass, no one can see me because I blend right in !” ',
            '“I’m invisible to everyone!” he went on, shouting in the direction of the frightened mouse. “I feel so… free! I can sit here, dance, sing, even jump! No one will find me! I have the best camouflage in the whole world!” ',
            'Out of his mind with arrogance, the grasshopper didn’t even notice that someone that was also as green as the grass was getting closer.',
            'Before the grasshopper could even sense the danger, the little field mouse whistled loudly. ',
            '“Grasshopper, watch out!” he said. “There’s a frog in the grass that wants to eat you!”',
            'The grasshopper saw the frog and was able to get to safety just in time.He hopped over to the little field mouse. ',
            '“Thank you, little mouse!” said the grasshopper. “You saved me with your caution! From now on, I’m going to stop bragging so much and be more mindful.” ',
            'The grasshopper and the little field mouse hid under a rock together until the frog and the fox moved away.',
