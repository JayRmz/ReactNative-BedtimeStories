# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> Node: 18.16.0

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.


## Step 1: Start the Metro Server


```bash

npx react-native start

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:


### For Android

>**Note**: For optimal development, make sure you already have an Android device connected or an emulator started.

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

### For iOS

>**Note**: For optimal development, make sure you already have an iOS device connected or a simulator started.

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
